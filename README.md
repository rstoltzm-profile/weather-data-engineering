# Weather Data Engineering Project

This project is an end-to-end data engineering pipeline that collects weather data, processes it using Kafka, and consumes the data for further processing and storage. The project is organized into several components:

- `010_collection`: Collects weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API.
- `020_kafka`: Kafka setup for data streaming.
- `030_consumers`: Consumes data from Kafka and processes it.
